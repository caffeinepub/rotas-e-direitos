  "summary": "The diff shows that REQ-2 has been fully implemented. The logo size in AppLayout.tsx was increased from previous dimensions (h-16 md:h-20 lg:h-24) to larger dimensions (h-20 md:h-24 lg:h-28), making it more prominent. The implementation maintains aspect ratio with object-contain, uses responsive classes for different viewports, and the header height was adjusted accordingly to accommodate the larger logo. No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
