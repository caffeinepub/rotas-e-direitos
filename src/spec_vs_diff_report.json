  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all four requirements: REQ-1 (black background), REQ-2 (orange/white text scheme), REQ-3 (logo integration), and REQ-4 (Tailwind CSS configuration updates). The diff shows comprehensive changes to the global CSS with black backgrounds (oklch(0 0 0)), white foreground text (oklch(1 0 0)), and vibrant orange primary colors (oklch(0.65 0.20 45)). The logo has been integrated into the AppLayout header with responsive sizing (h-10 w-auto object-contain md:h-12). The Tailwind configuration was updated with the new orange color palette. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the evidence provided.",
