## Summary
**Goal:** Update the application's visual design with a black background, orange and white text colors, and integrate the provided logo harmoniously.

**Planned changes:**
- Change all page backgrounds to black
- Update text colors to use orange for headings/accents and white for body text
- Integrate the user-provided logo into the header without disrupting layout or mobile responsiveness
- Update Tailwind CSS configuration and global styles to support the new color palette

**User-visible outcome:** The application will have a modern dark theme with black background, orange and white text, and a prominently displayed logo that works seamlessly across all devices.
