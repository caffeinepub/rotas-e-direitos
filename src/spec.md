# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a financial loss calculator with PDF export and implement dark mode for the Rotas e Direitos platform.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a financial loss calculator that allows drivers to input daily earnings, work days per week, and deactivation date
- Display calculated weekly, monthly, and accumulated losses in BRL
- Add a projection chart visualizing losses over time (up to 90 days)
- Implement PDF export functionality that generates a downloadable report with all calculated values and platform information
- Apply comprehensive dark mode theme across all pages and components with optimized contrast and readability for nighttime driving work

**User-visible outcome:** Drivers can calculate their financial losses from platform deactivation, visualize projected losses over time, export a detailed PDF report, and use the entire application in dark mode with reduced eye strain.
