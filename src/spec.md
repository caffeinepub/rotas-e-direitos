# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the application's color scheme to match the tonality of the logo.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the current warm orange primary and deep navy blue secondary colors in frontend/index.css with colors that match the logo's visual identity
- Update all color references throughout the app to reflect the new palette
- Ensure text maintains appropriate contrast ratios for accessibility
- Update dark mode color variants to maintain consistency
- Update the theme color in frontend/index.html and frontend/public/manifest.webmanifest to match the new primary color

**User-visible outcome:** The application will display a cohesive color scheme that aligns with the logo's visual identity across all pages, with consistent theming in browser UI elements and PWA displays.
