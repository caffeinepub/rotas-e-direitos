Replace the current warm orange primary colors (--color-primary, --color-primary-foreground) and deep navy blue secondary colors (--color-secondary, --color-secondary-foreground) with OKLCH values that match the logo's visual identity. Update all color variants including accent, muted, card, popover, and their dark mode counterparts to maintain visual consistency with the new palette. Ensure all color changes preserve WCAG AA contrast ratios for text and interactive elements. Maintain the existing OKLCH color space format and structure of the CSS variables. Do not modify the overall layout, typography, or component styling beyond color values."
