Modify the img element for 'nova logo-1.png' to use larger width and height values (e.g., increase from current size to approximately 150-200px width while maintaining aspect ratio). Ensure responsive behavior is preserved by using appropriate Tailwind classes (e.g., w-32 md:w-48 or similar) to scale appropriately on mobile and desktop viewports. Verify the logo does not cause overflow or alignment issues with adjacent navigation elements."
